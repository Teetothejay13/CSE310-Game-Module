# Overview

This game is a simple platformer, meant to demonstrate some of the features of the arcade library. Simply use WASD or the arrow keys to move the sprite around and jump onto the boxes. The movement is pretty easy to manage, however if you go off screen, you will have to restart the program to get back on, as there are no collisions for the edge of the screen.

I wrote this software mostly as a means to get familiar with the python arcade module. I have a project with a group of people that also involves creating a game, albeit more complex. This software was a means to teach myself the skills I'll need in my team.

# Development Environment

I used python in VS Code. I did not need any other tools, however I found a VS Code extention called Rainbow Indents that allows for better reading of indents. It was pretty useful.

The only library I used was arcade.
